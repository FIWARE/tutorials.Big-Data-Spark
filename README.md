This tutorial is an introduction to the [FIWARE Cosmos Orion Spark Connector](http://fiware-cosmos-spark.rtfd.io), which
enables easier Big Data analysis over context, integrated with one of the most popular BigData platforms:
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Apache Spark is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful
computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Spark has been designed to run in all common cluster environments,
perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as
[Postman documentation](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
